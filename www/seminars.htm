			<strong>Algebraic Graphs</strong> by Andrey Mokhov
			<span style="float:right;">15 November 2017, 13:30-14:30 @ USB.3.032</span>
		</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>
			We will discuss a new way of thinking about graphs, where instead of focusing
			on details (vertices and edges) we take a step back and discover a simple and
			unusual algebraic structure that characterises graphs, much like the ring theory
			characterises numbers. Algebraic graphs are implemented in
			<a href="https://github.com/snowleopard/alga">a Haskell library</a>.

			<strong>Structuring Effectful Computations</strong> by Georgy Lukyanov
			<span style="float:right;">1 November 2017, 16:00-17:00 @ USB.3.032</span>
		</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>
			Type systems of modern programming languages provide means to statically control
			side effects, such as mutable state, exceptions, IO, and many more. One of the most famous
			ways to do so are Haskell's Monads. During this seminar we're going to look at a couple of
			cases where controlled side effects make our lives easier.

			<strong>The Power of Randomness</strong> by Andrey Mokhov
			<span style="float:right;">30 October 2017, 16:00-17:00 @ Room E303, Merz Court</span>
		</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>
			Randomness can be a powerful ally and in this seminar we will hopefully get to know
			it a little better. We will discuss several examples where randomness allows us to find
			simple and effective solutions to problems that are otherwise difficult to tackle.
